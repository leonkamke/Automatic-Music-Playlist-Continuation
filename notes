TODO (important):
- add genre vector, get genre with k-means clustering applied on the set of all track vectors;
    for each cluster compute mean vector (this vector represents the genre)
- implement a transformer network
- ensemble
- Maybe implements cold start problem (empty playlist)

TODO(not important):
- improve track_embeddings (maybe spicy library)
