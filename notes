Pytorch version: 1.11.0
Cuda version: 11.3
Python version: 3.9.7

TODO (important):
- batches > 1 in encoder_decoder network (line 59!)
- output layer only with tracks, which appear min. 5 times in the mpd dataset
- make Dataloader faster (too much time between iterations) -> this would make training a lot faster
- add genre vector, get genre with k-means clustering applied on the set of all track vectors;
    for each cluster compute mean vector (this vector represents the genre)
- implement a transformer network
- ensemble
- Maybe implements cold start problem (empty playlist)

TODO(not important):
- improve track_embeddings (maybe spicy library)
