TODO (important):
- understand the Cross entropy loss and the Pytorch funktion, it's hard to let the neural network overfit (maybe because
    of the dimension of the output layer)
- get familiar with DFKI-account and NVIDIA cluster
- train seq2seq_D2KLab.py with NVIDIA cluster
- maybe test the following neural network architecture:
    input -> embedding layer -> recurrent layer (maybe more than 1 layers) -> embedding layer

TODO(not important):
- improve track_embeddings
